Todo when we get back:
 - Go over those lib files that have no home with Zane.
 - Figure out how to deploy to fly.io
 - Maybe try deploying on my server bc that'd be pretty cool and probably wayyy easier honestly
 - Work on branding and figuring out how to sell and stuff

# NOTE: TO MAKE AN ADMIN USER THAT INVITES HOSPICES YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY MAKE IT THROUGH SUPABASE BY MAKING A NEW USER THROUGH THE USER UI AND THEN ADDING THEIR ID TO THE ADMIN ID COLUMN!!

NEED TO FIX THE MANIFEST JSON NOT GETTING LOADED AND ALSO THE SERVICE WORKER IS JUST NOT WORKING AT ALL AND NOTHING IS GETTING CACHED

THE CACHE IS GETTING DELETED AFTER I REFRESH AND SO ONLY THE OFFLINE ROUTE WORKS OFFLINE
NOTE: TO ACTUALLY GET IT TO WORK AND TEST IT YOU NEED TO RUN `npm run build && npm run start`
